            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education refers to the discipline that is concerned with methods of
                teaching and learning in schools or school-like environments, as opposed to various nonformal and
                informal means of socialization.While education is not compulsory in practice everywhere in the world,
                the right of individuals to an educational program that respects their personality, talents, abilities,
                and cultural heritage has been upheld in various international agreements, including the Universal
                Declaration of Human Rights of 1948; the Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1959; and the
                International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966. </p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Every child deserves access to quality early childhood education.</p>
            <p class="sectionSunTag text-small">In low-income countries, the picture is bleaker, with only 1 in 5 young
                children enrolled. Children from poor families are the least likely to attend early childhood education
                programmes. For children who do have access, poorly trained educators, overcrowded and unstimulating
                environments, and unsuitable curricula diminish the quality of their experiences.

                Failure to provide quality early childhood education limits children’s futures by denying them
                opportunities to reach their full potential. It also limits the futures of countries, robbing them of
                the human capital needed to reduce inequalities and promote peaceful, prosperous societies.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Strengthening education systems and innovation</p>
            <p class="sectionSunTag text-small">Education systems are complex. Getting all children in school and
                learning requires alignment across families, educators and decision makers. It requires shared goals,
                and national policies that put learning at the centre. It also requires data collection and regular
                monitoring to help policymakers identify what’s working, who’s benefiting, and who’s being left behind.

                Strong education systems are inclusive and gender-equitable. They support early learning and
                multi-lingual education, and foster innovations to extend education opportunities to the
                hardest-to-reach children and adolescents.Innovation in education is about more than new technology.
                It’s about solving a real problem in a fresh, simple way to promote equity and improve learning.
